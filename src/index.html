        <p class="pb-2 ">We are "The Dogs" a Rock n Roll group from Bilbao, Basque Country. Since 2017, we have been working on a better alternative to classic rock and roll. We play others groups music but giving our best. The careful selection and execution of deep cut vinyl tracks will take you back to where you were when these gems were released. No costumes, just great tunes served up by a tight musical unit who truly love what they do, and give the proper respect and reverence the music deserves.</p>
        <p class="pb-2">We like to play our music anywhere, the street, in front of a small audience or in a big music concert. If we could choose, we like street the most. There we feel comfortable and can express our music at the best format. The music needs natural ways for expression, and the street and the improvisation give us that.</p class="py-2">
        <p class="pb-2">We haven't record any disc at the moment. The reason is simple, we like to play music in live.</p class="py-2">

        <p>After 2 years of steady gigs, "The Dogs" are clearly running on all cylinders and have the same enthusiasm since the first moment. With over 35 songs in the current library, "The Dogs" can easily play 2 hours without repeating a song. The list of artists runs from The Ramones, Bruce Springteen, ZZ Top, The Grateful Dead, The Cure, Beatles and Stones, to Zappa and inmaculate Fools to name a few.</p>
